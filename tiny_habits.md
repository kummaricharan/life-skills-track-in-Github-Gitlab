# Forget Big Change, Start with a Tiny Habit

## Key Takeaways

* **Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.** Small changes that are made consistently over time can lead to big results.
* **The key to forming a new habit is to make it tiny.** The smaller the habit, the easier it is to start and maintain.
* **A habit needs three things to work: a cue, a response, and a reward.** The cue is what triggers the habit, the response is the action that you take, and the reward is what makes the habit satisfying.
* **Make the cue obvious.** The easier it is to remember to do your habit, the more likely you are to do it.
* **Make the response attractive.** Make your habit something that you enjoy doing, or at least something that you don't dread doing.
* **Make the reward satisfying.** Give yourself a small reward for doing your habit, even if it's just a pat on the back.

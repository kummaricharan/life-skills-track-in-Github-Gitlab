## II: Area for Improvement and Ideas for Progress

I believe the area I need to improve on the most is "Doing Things with 100% Involvement." Here are my ideas to make progress in this area:

1. **Implement Deep Work Principles:** I'll dedicate specific time blocks for focused, distraction-free work. During these periods, I'll turn off notifications, close non-essential apps, and ensure that I'm fully immersed in the task at hand.

2. **Use Time Management Apps:** I'll start using time management apps like Boosted to track and analyze my work patterns. This will help me identify areas where I can improve my productivity and concentration.

3. **Reduce Social Media Distractions:** I'll utilize apps like Freedom or TimeLimit to block access to social media sites and apps during work hours. This will minimize the temptation to check these platforms while working.

4. **Optimize Nutrition:** I'll pay more attention to my diet, ensuring I have balanced meals during work hours. Overeating or undereating can negatively affect concentration, so I'll aim for a healthy balance.

5. **Regular Exercise:** I'll incorporate a daily exercise routine into my schedule. Physical activity can boost energy levels and help me stay focused throughout the day.

By focusing on these strategies, I aim to improve my ability to work with 100% involvement and maintain a higher level of productivity during remote work.
